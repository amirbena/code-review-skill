# Shared Policy — Failure State, Retry Safety, and Recovery

Applies identically to `local-code-review` and `github-pr-review`. It owns
the signal-triggered failure-state, retry-safety, and recovery pass: the
trigger conditions, the reasoning sequence once triggered, and the
applicability-gated observability hierarchy that decides whether a missing
detection/diagnosis signal is itself a finding.

This is a sub-domain of [`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md), which owns
base review scope and routes here. It introduces no second scope model:
findings, evidence, and severity are governed by
[`evidence.md`](evidence.md) and [`severity.md`](severity.md) exactly like
any other finding.

## Failure state, retry safety, and recovery

Treat this as one reasoning move, not three separate checklist items. It
triggers on a concrete signal in the diff: more than one side-effecting
step (for example, a persisted write followed by another operation), an
entry point that can plausibly run again for the same logical operation
(retry, redelivery, resubmission, at-least-once processing, queue/event/
webhook handling), or an external call combined with a state mutation —
payment and similarly sensitive workflows are a common case, not the only
one. Absent such a signal, this section does not apply and requires no
action.

When triggered, reason about: what state is left if the flow fails
partway; which side effects may already have happened by that point;
whether the logical operation can safely run again from that state
without duplicating work or external effects; and, when the code or
surrounding context claims another process reconciles the stranded state,
whether that recovery/reconciliation path actually exists in the
repository and actually covers this new state — never accepted merely
because "another process will eventually fix it," with no evidence that
such a process exists or handles this case.

### Observability is applicability-gated, not universal

Where this reasoning surfaces a meaningful, hard-to-detect failure mode,
weigh whether it would be operationally visible — but only after first
asking whether the change actually has a production-operational failure
mode for which detection or diagnosis is materially relevant. Observability
is not equally important for every kind of change:

- **Commonly relevant**: backend/service runtime behavior, payments or
  other high-impact business operations, queues/events/webhooks, external
  integrations, asynchronous processing, persistence combined with side
  effects, retries/redelivery, background jobs, and production
  orchestration.
- **Conditionally relevant for frontend/client changes**: only when the
  application already has an established client telemetry/error-reporting
  convention, the change introduces an operationally important runtime
  failure, and that failure would otherwise be materially difficult to
  diagnose. Do not turn an ordinary frontend review into a search for
  backend-style metrics.
- **Usually secondary or not applicable**: changes primarily to agent
  instructions, prompts, review Skills, policy Markdown, static docs, or
  non-runtime configuration — unless the changed system actually has
  runtime behavior of its own (agent orchestration, tool-invocation
  failures, persistent execution state, retries, scheduled/background
  execution, production telemetry), in which case the reasoning below
  applies to that runtime behavior specifically, not to the surrounding
  static content.

Concretely: does this diff introduce or modify a production-operational
failure mode for which detection or diagnosis is materially relevant? Only
when the answer is yes does the hierarchy below apply, preferring the
repository's own established mechanism over inventing a new one:

- If the surrounding system already uses metrics, counters,
  failure-reason classifications, or alerts for comparable flows, check
  only that the changed or new failure path participates in that existing
  mechanism consistently — it is not silently bypassed, misclassified, or
  invisible to an alert that depends on it.
- If the surrounding code relies primarily on logs, check only whether
  the existing logging convention still lets an operator distinguish the
  meaningful cases this change affects — success vs. failure, retryable
  vs. terminal, partial failure/stranded state, an important state
  transition, recovery triggered vs. failed, and enough identifying
  context to trace one instance. This is about fitting the existing
  convention, never a generic "add more logs" recommendation.
- Absent any established observability precedent, a missing signal is a
  finding only when the diff introduces or materially changes a
  high-impact failure mode that would otherwise be effectively
  undiagnosable through anything already in the repository — the concern
  is that the failure is undetectable, not merely that a particular
  metric is absent.

This does not require enumerating every failure point in every review;
apply it where the diff's own shape makes it relevant, and scale depth to
actual risk exactly as [`evidence.md`](evidence.md) already scales
dependency exploration to blast radius.
