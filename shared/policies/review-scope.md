# Shared Policy — Review Scope

Defines what any Code Review Skill in this repository examines, regardless
of whether it is `local-code-review` or `github-pr-review`.

## What is examined

- changed files
- the full diff (not only a truncated preview)
- relevant surrounding code needed to judge the change fairly
- tests (existing and missing)
- schemas and migrations
- configuration
- infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, CI/CD, GitHub
  Actions, etc.)
- documentation
- repository contracts (APIs, interfaces, public behavior)

## Materially relevant concerns

Where applicable to the change: correctness, regressions, architecture
fidelity, contract fidelity, APIs, compatibility, data integrity,
security, concurrency, reliability, error handling, edge cases,
idempotency, database safety, migration safety, deployment safety,
infrastructure behavior, CI/CD behavior, test adequacy, missing regression
tests, operational risk, maintainability, repository conventions, and
documentation correctness.

## Technology neutrality

Every Skill built on this policy must remain technology-neutral. It must
not require a specific language, framework, architecture, repository
layout, deployment model, or infrastructure platform. It supports mixed
changes across arbitrary stacks (application code, tests, SQL, IaC,
CI/CD, YAML/JSON, Markdown, Agent/Skill instructions, and other
repository files). File extensions alone are never authoritative — the
reviewer reasons from code and context.

## Restraint

Do not manufacture findings merely to appear thorough. A clean review
with zero findings is a valid, complete outcome.
